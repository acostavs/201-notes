## How The Web Works

When you visit a website your computer is a client requesting a web page from a server, which is the place the document is stored. Your computer can be a server and a client.

## My Poem

DNS find this page. Don't know the IP, I know it's called Gage. Check your tables and let me know the way. When you work I'll get a 200 OK

## How File Are Parsed

The browser parsed the html file first, checking for a link and script tags. If it finds these tags the browser will request the documents linked and parse them next. The bowser then creates a DOM tree for the html, a CSSOM for the css, and executes the javascript as it creates the DOM and applies the css rules.

## Web Images

You can find images for your website on google images. Just right-click the image, hit save as, and save it in a safe place.

## JS Basics

To make a string in JS

1. Declare a variable with let or const.
2. Assign it single/double quotes and the string you want.

To declare a number type variable

1. Declare a variable with let or const.
2. assign it a number with no quotation.

Variables are containers that store values. Variables are important because they allow us to make our site dynamic.

## HTML Basics

An attribute has extra info about the element. A few examples are

* The href in an anchor tag
* The class you gave an element
* The src attribute

An HTML element consists of an opening, a closing tag, and the content. The difference between an article and section tag is that section is for parts of the your page that constitutes one single piece of functionality(i.e. A map on a restautant site that gives you directions to them). Article is for grouping related content

### Typical Website tags

You will typically see that HTML documents contain a

* header tag
* nav tag
* main tag
* footer tag

## Metadata

Metadata influences Search Engine Optimization becausehas it can make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines. Metadata gives the browser extra info the user doesn't need to see. Things like the character encoding and links to your CSS and JS files.

## Designing a Website

The first step to designing a website is asking yourself:

* What do I do I want to accomplish?
* How will this site help me accomplish my task?
* What needs to be done and in what order?

The most important of these questions is What do I do I want to accomplish?

## Semantics

You should use an h1 element over a span element to display a top level heading because that is the main reason purpose of an h1 tag.

A benefit to using semantic language in our html is that it helps people that need screen readers to use their computers. Semantic html will emphasise the important parts of your document.

## Javascript

One thing that requires JS is dynamically modifying HTML and CSS to update a user interface. Another is adding Event Listeners.

You can add JS using the internal, external, and inline methods.
